## Sorting Algorithms

For this assignment you will be responsible for the following:

1. Create a module that implements each of the folowing sorting algorithms:
  1. [Quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
  1. [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
  1. [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
  1. [Insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
  1. [Selection sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

Each module should be able to sort a randomized array of numbers.

1. Create a README.md file and for each algorithm include the following:
  1. Explain to a five year old how the algorithm works (3-4 sentences max)
  1. Psuedo code for each sorting implementation
  1. In your own words, describe the performance of the alogirthm for the following cases:
    1. Best case scenario
    1. Worst case scenario
